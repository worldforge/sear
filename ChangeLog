	* src/Character.cpp, src/Character.h: Modify the findInInventory
	  function to search for ID first, then name, then type. Modify
	  dropEntity, giveEntity to use this function. Added a 
	  /return_to_origin command to move to 0,0,0 to help when lost. Added a 
	  /rename_entity to rename an entity in the inventory if allowed by the
	  server. Randomized the drop position to anywhere within +-1.0f in the
	  x or y direction.

2007-01-21 Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/Graphics.cpp: Fix bug where +show_bbox would cause an 
	  attached entity to be rendered twice. Fix bug where the show_attached
	  ObjectRecord flag was ignored if it was false.

2007-01-12  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/Graphics.cpp: When +show_bbox is used, do not render
	  bounding boxes for entities with no bounding box.

2007-01-12  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* environment/TerrainRenderer.cpp: Added check to see if a terrain

	  const_iterator.end() outside a loop declaration.

	* src/System.cpp: Cache many uses of const_iterator.end() outside a loop
	  declaration. Disable joysticks by default. Move joystick 
	  initialisation after startup scripts have been processed so custom
	  enabling will work.

2007-01-11  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* guichan/CharacterWindow.cpp: Fix bug where double clicking on a
	  character could fail with a message saying to select a character.

2006-12-03  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/StaticObject.h, loaders/StaticObject.cpp: Implement fallback
	  outlining method when stencil buffers are not available/required.
	  Added a useStencil flag to indicate whether or not to use a stencil
	  buffer.

	* loaders/3ds_Loader.cpp, loaders/BoundBox_Loader.cpp,
	  loaders/LibModelFile_Loader.cpp, loaders/NPlane_Loader.cpp: Determine
	  whether or not to use the stencil buffer for outlining based on 
	  whether one is available and whether the outlining method requires it.

2006-12-03  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/3ds.cpp: Clean up render function.

	* loaders/3ds.h, loaders/BoundBox.h, loaders/LibModelFile.h,
	  loaders/Model.h, loaders/NPlane.h: Return StaticObjectList by
	  reference.

	* loaders/3ds_Loader.cpp, loaders/BoundBox_Loader.cpp,
	  loaders/LibModelFile_Loader.cpp, loaders/NPlane_Loader.cpp: Store
	  normal and render states in the StaticObjects on creation time.

	* loaders/StaticObject.cpp, loaders/StaticObject.h: Implemented
	  outlining (stencil buffer method only) and select mode for the meshes.

	* renderers/GL.cpp, renders/GL.h, renders/Render.h: Removed lots of
	  unused functions. Use new flag on WorldEntity to check selected status
	  rather than by ID comparisons.

	* renderers/RenderSystem.cpp, renderers/RenderSystem.h,
	  renderers/StateManager.h: Added a method to force a full state change
	  for use within display lists.

	* src/WorldEntity.cpp, src/WorldEntity.h: Added an isSelected flag and
	  accessors to store whether a entity is currently selected or not.

2006-12-03  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/Graphics.cpp: Only calculate transform matrix for static
	  objects.

2006-12-03  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/BoundBox.cpp, loaders/BoundBox.h, loaders/NPlane.cpp,
	  loaders/NPlane.h: Added StaticObjectList functions to these model 
	  types to move them into the new render queue.

	* loaders/3ds.cpp, loaders/ModelLoader.cpp: Removed some commented bits.

2006-12-03  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* gui/Caret.cpp, gui/Frame.cpp, gui/Text.cpp, gui/Workspace.cpp: Fix

2006-12-02  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/Model.h, loaders/ModelHandler.h, loaders/ModelHandler.cpp:
	  Make getPositionForSubmodel const. This fixes wielded entity positions
	  which stopped working when caldmodel methods were const'd.

	* loaders/Model.h, loaders/ObjectRecord.h, loaders/ObjectRecord.cpp:
	  Added methods to handle entities being "worn" and "removed".

	* loaders/cal3d/Cal3dCoreModel.h, loaders/cal3d/Cal3dModel.cpp,
	  loaders/cal3d/Cal3dModel.h, loaders/cal3d/Cal3d_Loader.cpp:
	  Implemented methods to handle entities being "worn" and "removed".
	  Added a field in the config file specifying a further config file
	  containing a mapping between an entity name and meshes and materials.
	  This config also contains a default section specifying the meshes and
	  materials to use by default. All meshes are added if this section does
	  not exist.

	* src/WorldEntity.cpp, src/WorldEntity.h: Hook up ChildAdded and
	  ChildRemoved to entities being worn/removed until a better method is
	  implemented. Entities need to be defined in the cal3d appearance map
	  if they are to do anything.

2006-12-02  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/GL.cpp: Fix item selection.

2006-12-02  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/GL.cpp: Decrease sleep_time to make splash screen more 
	  responsive.

	* guichan/CharacterWindow.cpp: Replace the character types list box 
	  with a drop down box.

2006-12-02  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* guichan/LoginWindow.cpp: Add check for an empty password field.

2006-11-30  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	  a default implementation returning an empty list.

	* loaders/3ds.cpp, loaders/3ds.h: Implements the StaticObject list
	  function.

	* loaders/ModelHandler.h, loaders/ModelSystem.cpp, 
	  loaders/ModelSystem.h, loaders/cal3d/Cal3dCoreModel.cpp, 
	  loaders/cal3d/Cal3dCoreModel.h, loaders/cal3d/Cal3dModel.cpp,
	  loaders/cal3d/Cal3dModel.h, loaders/cal3d/Cal3d_Loader.cpp,
	  loaders/cal3d/Cal3d_Loader.cpp, loaders/cal3d/CoreModelHandler.cpp,
	  loaders/cal3d/CoreModelHandler.h: Make greater use of smart pointers
	  to managed objects.

	* loaders/StaticObject.cpp, loaders/StaticObject.h: Make some methods
	  const and some members mutable. Probably a terrible misuse of this
	  feature.

2006-11-30  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/ActionHandler.cpp, src/Calendar.cpp, src/Character.cpp,
	  src/System.cpp, src/TerrainEntity.cpp, src/WorldEntity.cpp,
	  src/client.cpp: Update sigc::mem_fun instead of SigC::slot.

	* src/System.h, src/main.cpp: Use auto_ptr to hold System object.

2006-11-25  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/Calendar.cpp: Add initialiser for m_seconds.

2006-11-25  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/GL.cpp, renderers/GL.h: Up number of objects from 512 to 24
	  bits worth -- 8 bits per colour plane (RGB). Call SDL_Delay instead of
	  usleep to reduce CPU usage on the splash screen.

2006-11-02  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/Graphics.cpp: Remove unused const sleep_time;

	* src/System.cpp, src/System.h: Add call to SDL_Delay in main loop. Add
	  config option, render_delay, with a default value of 0 to allow people
	  to force a pause between each frame.

2006-10-25  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* common/Matrix.h: Fix translate method. Make getMatrix const.

	* loaders/StaticLoader.h, loaders/StaticLoader.cpp: Added new render
	  method that takes a list of Matrix objects representing entity
	  position/orientation in the world. The matrices are looped around the
	  final glDrawArrays/Elements call rather than the whole vertex buffer
	  setup. This will speed up the rendering of the same model multiple 
	  times once the render queue is modified.

2006-10-25  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/StateManager.cpp: Remove assert on missing state definitions

2006-10-25  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/WireFrame.cpp: Fix up another display list usage in the

	* loaders/StaticObject.cpp, environment/TerrainRenderer.cpp: Replace
	  GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE with just GL_COMPILE and a later glCallList to
	  work around a problem with Intel graphics cards.

2006-10-17  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/System.cpp: Change default window size to 800x600 instead of

	* configure.ac: Check for both empty string and for NONE in configure
	  check.

2006-10-08  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* configure.ac: Make sure -Wall is always added to CXXFLAGS. In the
	  AC_PATH_X check, look for NONE rather than empty string. Might break 
	  older versions of this macro. Feedback welcome.

	* guichan/CharacterWindow.cpp, guichan/ConnectWindow.cpp,
	  guichan/ConnectWindow.h, guichan/Workarea.cppm guichan/Workarea.h: Add
	  a removeLater function to add a widget to a list of widgets to be
	  removed from their parent container when a button callback is hit.
	  This avoids a guichan exception being thrown for removing a widget
	  from the GUI while processing an input event. A call to removeLaters
	  performs the actual removal. Made the ConnectWindow refresh button a
	  class member.

	* renderers/Render.h: Remove extra ;

	* src/FileHandler.cpp, src/FileHandler.h: Added SEAR_HOME/sear-media-0.6
	  by default to the SEAR_MEDIA search path rather than attempt to add it
	  in the sear script. Added a function to delete a variable such as
	  SEAR_HOME and added get/set_variable console commands to eventually
	  replace getvar and setvar.

	* src/sear.in: Removed the creation of the startup.script file as the
	  changes implemented here are built into sear. Check that the reference
	  path for WFUT media exists before attempting to use it.

2006-10-08  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* guichan/DblClkListBox.h: Added a list box subclass that listens for
	  double clicks and fires a given event.

	* guichan/ConnectWindow.cpp, guichan/CharacterWindow.cpp: Use the new
	  DblClkListBox class to allow double clicking of a server to connect to
	  it, or on an existing character to take it.

2006-10-07  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/Sprite.cpp: Remove sprite loading error message.

	* src/sear-res.rc.in: Use correct version number in win32 metadata.

2006-10-07  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* configure.ac: Bump guichan version to 0.5.0 and sage to 0.2.0.

	  guichan/RootWidget.cpp, guichan/SpeechBubble.cpp,
	  guichan/SpeechBubble.h, guichan/StatusWindow.cpp,
	  guichan/TaskWindow.cpp, guichan/VideoOptions.cpp,
	  guichan/VideoOptions.h, guichan/Workarea.cpp, guichan/Workarea.h,
	  guichan/bar.cpp, guichan/passwordfield.cpp: Updated to guichan 0.5.0
	  API. Use getFilePath to load images instead of expandString.

2006-10-01  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* configure.ac: Fix SDL_mixer error message which was asking for 
	  SDL_sound.

2006-10-01  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/3ds_Loader.cpp: Use getFilePath instead of expandString.

	* src/FileHandler.cpp, src/FileHandler.h: Add function to return all
	  filepaths for a given location. Set SEAR_MEDIA to a multi-location
	  var instead of a single valued var. Rename FileList to FileSet and 
	  create a FileList that is really a list.

	* src/ScriptEngine.cpp: Use FileSet instead of FileList. Call 
	  getFilePath instead of expandString.

	* src/System.cpp: Use FileSet instead of FileList.

	* src/sear.in: Use install_file_path instead of setvar for SEAR_MEDIA.
	  Added some missing UPDATED flags. Added ref command to WFUT to support
	  read-only media locations and download update into home dir.

2006-09-17  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/3ds.cpp, loaders/LibModelFile.cpp,

	  renderers/StateManager.cpp, renderers/TextureManager.cpp,
	  src/Console.cpp src/FileHandler.cpp, src/FileHandler.h,
	  src/System.cpp: Move setvar and getvar to FileHandler. Added some
	  functions so we can find a file from a number of locations. E.g.
	  media in home dir or a system location otherwise.

2006-07-15  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/WorldEntity.cpp: Make warning messages more useful.

2006-07-15  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* guichan/Overlay.cpp, guichan/SpeechBubble.h: Add a timeout to speech
	  bubbles of 10 seconds since last update. This should probably be made
	  configurable.

2006-07-15  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/Calender.cpp: Fix bug in calculation of m_time_in_area that

	* loaders/ModelSystem.cpp: Added some comments.

	* loaders/LibModelFile.h: Make StaticObjectList typedef public.

	* loaders/LibModelFile.cpp: Add z_align and scale_isotropic and
	  scale_anisotropic options as with the 3ds loader.

	* loaders/3ds_Loader.cpp: Do call setHeight as we now end up scaling by

2006-04-24  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/StaticObject.h: Add method to obtain the current transform
	  matrix.

	* loaders/3ds.h, loaders/3ds.cpp: Add options to anisotropically or
	  isotropically scale an object to a unit size. Useful when using in
	  combination with scale_bbox in model_records. This needs to be ported
	  to libmodelfile and cal3d loaders.

2006-03-27  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/sear.rc, src/sear-res.rc.in: Rename
	  sear.rc to sear-res.rc.in to avoid compiling two sear.o objects. Add
	  Win32 Version information to the resource file and pull the VERSION 
	  var from configure. Update Makefile.am to avoid circular dependancy
	  warning for building the resource file.

2006-02-27  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/StaticObject.h: Change the setMatrix to use float [][] instead
	  of float **.

2006-02-27  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/Camera.h, src/Character.cpp: Add some checks so that a 
	  movement or rotation rates are limited to +/- 1. This helps fix some 
	  of the bugs caused by missing a key press or release. The keypress
	  will still be missed, but e.g if the char is walking forwards
	  automatically, pressing and releasing forward again will fix it.

2006-02-25  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/StaticObject.cpp, loaders/DynamicObject.cpp: Add glPushMatrix
	  and glPopMatrix to the render function.

	  loaders/cal3d/Cal3dCoreModel.h: Add new config section called 
	  bone_rotations allowing a rotation to be applied to each bone when 
	  wielding an object. Format is wield_slot_name = "w;x;y;z" where w, x,
	  y and z are components of a quaternion.

2006-02-25  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/WireFrame.cpp: Fix bug where the display list was never 
	  created before using it.

	* renderers/Frustum.cpp: Fix bug in sphereInFrustum() where the bounding
	  box center was moved to entity position, instead of just being 
	  translated by the position.

2006-02-24  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/Character.cpp, src/Character.h: Limit move ops to no more than 
	  once per 500 milliseconds and only if there is a change in velocity
	  or orientation. Remove eris timeouts and just check against current
	  seconds. Use WorldEntity::setLocalOrient to make rotations smooth.

2006-02-23  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/Graphics.cpp: Fix camera clamp to terrain. Also fix camera
	  height to be 1m above character.

2006-02-23  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/WorldEntity.cpp: Update getAbsPos to take into account the terrain
	  height for all entities in the hierarchy. This fixes the wielded
	  object staying at a constant height while the container entity changed
	  height until the next move op was received. Fix the heights for
	  swimming and walking on the jetty.

2006-02-23  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/cal3d/Cal3dModel.cpp: Give a consitent orientaion in both 
	  hands. Wielded models need a secondary rotation to make then face the 
	  right way.

2006-02-22  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/cal3d/Cal3dCoreModel.cpp: Fix bug where a section name less 
	  than the size of "animation" would cause an out of range error. Rename
	  bone_map to bone_mapping so that the .cal config files will work with
	  versions of sear without this fix.

2006-02-21  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/System.cpp: Fix mouse look movement (it was inverted).

2006-02-21  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/Graphics.cpp: Fix wielded entity position for entities 
	  scaled by bbox or by height.

2006-02-20  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/GL.cpp: Fix rendering of currently selected entity.

2006-02-20  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/System.cpp, src/client.cpp: Change some debugging output.

	* src/Character.cpp: Fix some rotation code.

2006-02-20  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/Graphics.cpp: Update code to properly use rotations from 
	  WorldEntity and new rotations from Camera objects. The camera no
	  longer is stopped from going through terrain. Removed old attachment
	  code.

2006-02-20  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/Camera.cpp, renderers/Camera.h, renderers/CameraSystem.cpp:
	  Use a wfmath vector and rotation to handle camera settings and remove
	  old getAngle and getX/Y/ZPos functions. Add a /reset_camera to re-read
	  the general config file.

	* renderers/Render.h: Remove display list functions.

	* renderers/GL.cpp, renderers/GL.h: Move store and restore methods to
	  headerfile. Update code to properly use rotations from WorldEntity and
	  new rotations from Camera objects. The camera no longer is stopped
	  from going through terrain. Removed old attachment code.

2006-02-20  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/WorldEntity.cpp: Correctly handle rotation and positions changes 
	  from parent entities. These changes do not correctly translate for
	  terrain height between server updates.

2006-02-20  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/WireFrame.cpp, loaders/WireFrame.h: Call display list
	  functions directly instead of via the Render class.

2006-02-20  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/3ds.cpp, loaders/LibModelFile.cpp: Change some debugging ouput

2006-02-20  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/cal3d/CoreModel.cpp, loaders/cal3d/Cal3dModel.h: Remove scale
	  transform as it is done within the core model directly. Change 
	  getPositionForSubModel to use the new bone-mapping api and perform
	  more correct transforms. (Remove scaling as it is done within the api 
	  and rotate according with m_rotate instead of hardcoded 90.0 degrees).
	  Remove lots of old, commented out code.

2006-02-20  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* guichan/Inventory.cpp: Use a reference to the InventoryMap instead of
	  copying it.

	* loaders/cal3d/Cal3dCoreModel.cpp, loaders/cal3d/Cal3dCoreModel.h: 
	  Allow a new section in the configfile called "bone_map". This maps the
	  wielded slot names from cyphesis to the name of a bone in the cal3d
	  model. Scale the model using the Cal3D Api instead of peforming an 
	  extra opengl transform.

2006-02-19  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* src/error.cpp: On OS-X, use the Dialog Manager to display a
	  standard alert via Carbon. Inside Macintosh is dead, but the
	  toolbox will never die.

2006-02-18  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/WorldEntity.cpp, src/WorldEntity.h: Allow a local position and
	  orientation to be specified. This affects the position and orientation
	  of the entity within its current location. Stop using the local pos
	  and orient if the location entity changes.

	* renderers/Graphics.cpp, renderers/Graphics.h: Use the WorldEntity
	  local overrides for re-positioning wielded objects. This now allows
	  entities contained within the wielded entity to be properly
	  positioned. Fix bug where camera angle for character was incorrectly
	  calculated.

2006-02-18  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/Character.cpp, src/Character.h: Use WFMath directly to handle 
	  predicted velocity and rotation. Refresh predicated orientation from
	  entity on location change.

2006-02-18  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/Sound.cpp: Add cassert include required by some compilers.

2006-02-18  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/Graphics.h: Add member vars for cached stateIDs

2006-02-18  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/RenderSystem.h, renderers/RenderTypes.h: Move TextureID and
	  StateID declaration to RenderTypes.h.

2006-02-18  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/ParticleSystem.cpp: Allow a status value of 1.0.

	* loaders/cal3d/Cal3dModel.cpp: Check that there are texture
	  coordinates defined, texture maps defined and a filename for a 
	  texture map before allowing a mesh to be textured. This stop the
	  "texture  not defined" message on the stdout.

	* renderers/Graphics.cpp: Request State during init instead of each 
	  frame. Render the compass after the weather effects. Switch back to
	  perspective mode after rendering rain.

	* renderers/RenderSystem.cpp, renderers/StateManager.cpp, 
	  renderers/StateManager.h: Rename getState to requestState. Tell 
	  requestState to create a new empty record and return a valid stateID 
	  even if one does not exist. This allows requesting state id's before
	  the state records have been loaded. (similar behaviour to the
	  TextureManager). Use SPtr to store StateProperties.

	* renderers/TextureManager.cpp, renderers/TextureManager.h: Use a
	  variable to store next available texture id instead of using the size
	  of the names array. (I suspect that there was an out-by-one error in
	  here). Make the loadTexture functions private.

2006-02-18  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/Character.cpp, src/Character.h: Create a map (InvetoryMap) 
	  storing entity name (or type name) and the number of times it occurs
	  in the characters inventory. Allow other classes to access this map.

	* guichan/Inventory.cpp: Use the new Character::InventoryMap to "stack"
	  items in the list. You will now see an entry like "coin (5)". Any
	  actions still apply to only one instance of an item.

2006-02-18  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>
	
	* guichan/WorkArea.cpp: Fix inventory gui opening with /inventory 
	  command. It was broken due to a lower case 'i'.

	* src/Character.cpp: Do not display inventory as a system message now 
	  gui window is fixed.

2006-02-17  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* environment/Weather.cpp: Do not hardcode window size! Only use 2 
	  floats per vertex. Remove redundant point parameter calls.

2006-02-16  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* environment/Weather.cpp, environment/Weather.h, data/states.cfg,
	  environment/Environment.cpp, environment/Environment.h,
	  renderers/Graphics.cpp: Tidy up reading rain and snow attributes from
	  weather entity. Render "rain" using random points. Use the 
	  GL_ARB_POINT_SPRITE if available to render rain, else use a single pt
	  point. Create a new "weather" render state. New media for the rain is
	  in wfut media channel.

2006-02-16  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/ModelLoader.cpp: Remove some debugging asserts.

	  Create a new header, RenderTypes storing Rotation- and Render-Style 
	  enums to avoid having to include Graphics.h.

	* renderers/RenderSystem.h, loaders/ParticleSystemLoader.cpp,
	  loaders/ModelRecord.cpp: Do not export StateManager and use
	  RenderSystem functions instead.

	* loaders/ModelHandler.cpp: Make error output more verbose.

	* loaders/StaticObject.cpp: Fix bug where the display lists would not 
	  record the texture change and so could use the wrong one. Make sure
	  there is data in the buffers before using them.

	* renderers/Camera.h, renderers/CameraSystem.h, renderers/GL.h,
	  renderers/Graphics.h, renderers/Render.h, renderers/StateManager.h,

	  that it had some. Remove render with with args function.

	* loaders/StaticObject.cpp, loaders/DynamicObject.cpp: Move call to
	  identity() to the init function. Initialise material properties.

	* loaders/DynamicObject.cpp: Use colour arrays in no VBO mode too.

2006-02-15  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* loaders/DynamicObject.cpp, loaders/DynamicObject.h: Make indices an
	  int instead of unsigned int (for now at least!). Fix bug in
	  copyIndices where the wrong VBO was being reset. Do not attempt to do
	  anything to textures if there is no texture coord data.

	* loaders/cal3d/Cal3dCoreModel.cpp, loaders/cal3d/CoreModel.h,
	  loaders/cal3d/Cal3dModel.cpp, loaders/Cal3dModel.h: Use Dynamic Object

	  loaders/WireFrame_Loader.h, loaders/cal3d/Cal3d_Loader.h: Add a 
	  getType function to the model loaders to return its name. Use a SPtr
	  to store the model loaders in the model handler. Update the 
	  registerModelLoader fruntion to just take the smart pointer and use 
	  getType() to map the name. Update the de-register function to just
	  take the name.

2004-10-18  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* gui/Workspace.h, gui/Workspace.cpp, gui/Window.h, gui/Window.cpp:
	  Add event handler for keypress events.

	* TextEntry.cpp TextEntry.h: New widget for entering text.

2004-10-16  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* gui/Box.cpp, gui/Box.h, gui/Button.cpp, gui/Button.h,
	  gui/Container.cpp, gui/Container.h, gui/Frame.cpp, gui/Frame.h,
	  gui/Label.cpp, gui/Label.h, gui/Toplevel.cpp, gui/Toplevel.h,
	  gui/Widget.h, gui/Window.cpp, gui/Window.h, gui/Workspace.cpp,
	  gui/Workspace.h, gui/event.h: More progress with the gui at last.

2004-10-11  Simon Goodall  <sear@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/Console.cpp: Show console by default on startup so newbie's have
	  some idea of what to do.

2004-09-29  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* src/WorldEntity.cpp, src/WorldEntity.h: further code cleans-ups,
	  removing 'abs_pos' and 'abs_orient' members (and hence the code to
	  update them) in favour of just computing the value directly. abs_pos
	  in particular was not being used by the old code at all.
	  
	* common/types.h, src/Utility.cpp: turn OrientBBox into a class, and
	  add some helper methods for constructing and rotating it, which
	  makes code in WorldEntity more readable. This should probably all be
	  changed to use WFMath oriented bboxs, but that's a much bigger job.

2004-09-24  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/WorldEntity.cpp: Fix direction of orientation calculation.

2004-09-24  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* src/WorldEntity.cpp, src/WorldEntity.h: change how absolute entity
	  position is calculated, so the interpolated position is always
	  applied in location coordinates. Also remove the deeply confusing
	  'SetVelocity' method that actually just set a time.

2004-07-29  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* common/Utility.cpp, common.Utility.h, renderer/GL.cpp, src/.cvsignore,
	  src/Console.cpp, src/Console.h, src/Graphics.cpp, src/Graphics.h,
	  src/System.cpp, src/System.h: Console autocomplete, improved line 
	  editing and support for quotes by HagenM. Also key repeat delays are
	  user configurable and command history is saved.

2004-07-27  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/sear.in: Use $datadir instead of $prefix/share. Use $homedata for
	 $HOME/.sear

	* src/System.cpp: Fix code formatting. Do not print cmd line args.
	* src/sear.in: Script file to run updater if found before starting
	  sear.bin

2004-07-14  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* sear-media.spec.in: Initial version of spec file to generate media rpm
	  using WFUT.
	* sear.spec.in: Updated for current sear state
	* common/Utility.h: gcc 3.4 fixes
	* renderers/TextureManager.cpp: Fix warning

	  new Use and Wield op classes.

	* src/Character.cpp, src/Character.h: Add new use and wield
	  commands to character using new ops.

2004-06-26  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* src/system.cpp, src/Filehandler.h, src/FileHandler.cpp: Change storage type from list to set to avoid duplicates. Make code use typedef for FileList

2004-06-26  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* renderers/GL.cpp: Fix bug where sun light source was disabled	

2004-06-26  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>

2004-06-24  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* Add support for world editing (via an admin account) using commands
	  bound to keys. New functionality in Editor class, created by system,
	  which will handle all the privileged commands.
	
	* Make the command binder handle modifier keys: preprend various magic
	  strings based on the modifier state.
	  
	* Update standard bindings.cfg with some default bindings for the
	  edit keys.

2004-06-21  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>
	* src/WorldEntity.cpp: Add action events for mode and action changed
	* src/Character.cpp: Rename action event to avoid name clashes
	* src/Model.h, src/ObjectRecord.h, src/WorldEntity.cpp: Dyamically
	  resize models when bbox changes.

2004-06-22  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* Make joystick axes configurable in general.cfg

2004-06-21  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/Character.cpp: Add objtype to arguments of Set ops for
	  customizing characters.

2004-06-20  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>
	* src/WorldEntity.cpp: Add a "swimming" mode check

2004-06-20  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>
	* src/Graphics.cpp: Add missing check for draw_self from object_records;
	* src/Character.cpp, src/Character.h: Add /set_height command to change character height. Model height is not updated dynamically yet.
	* common/types.h, src/Frustum.h, src.Frustum.cpp, src/Graphics.cpp, src/WorldEntity.h, src/WorldEntity.h: Added code to orientate the bounding box to the quaternion of the entity. Add frustum check for this. Not enabled by default. Need to change method near the "Change method here" comment in src/Graphics.cpp

2004-06-20  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* loaders/3ds.cpp: Add in a scale transform when rendering 3ds
	  files which some models seem to need.

2004-06-20  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>
	* loaders/BoundBox.cpp: Fix incorrect texture bug when using display lists

2004-06-15  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>
	* loaders/3ds.cpp: Fix segfault on models with no texture through using unitialised values;

2004-06-19  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* environment/TerrainRenderer.cpp: Re-arrange terrain shaders, for
	  better looking hills.

2004-06-18  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* environment/TerrainRenderer.cpp: Be sure to use heap allocation
	  to big arrays, rather than stack.

2004-06-15  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* loaders/3ds.cpp: Only render meshes directly if the 3ds file does
	  not contain a node structure.

2004-06-15  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>
	* Further appearance fixes. Now loads appearance at startup

2004-06-15  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/System.cpp, src/Character.cpp: Remove debugging output
	  that was slowing down rotation.

2004-06-15  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/Event.h, src/Event.cpp: Add a new event to explicitly send an
	  update to the server.

	* src/Character.h, src/Character.cpp: If the user moves the mouse,
	  avoid sending an update to the server if one has been sent recently.

2004-06-13  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>
	* Initial workings to allow appearance attributes of character to be changed. /read_app reads the properties from the server. /set_app is used to set mesh and material properties. E.g. "/set_app mesh head 1" changes head mesh. "/set_app material head alternative" changes head material. /clear_app clears current settings

2004-06-13  Simon Goodall  <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>
	* Fix bug where the render active name function did select the correct state to render with.

2004-06-13  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* Fix up all the Makefile.am files so that distcheck works.

2004-06-11  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/Render.h, renderers/GL.h, renderers/GL.cpp,
	  common/Utility.h, common/Utility.cpp:
	  Change some pass by value arguments to pass by reference
	  for efficiency.

2004-06-10  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/WorldEntity.h, src/WorldEntity.cpp,
	  src/Frustum.h, src/Frustum.cpp,
	  src/Character.h, src/Character.cpp:
	  Change some pass by value arguments to pass by reference
	  for efficiency.

	* gui/Workspace.cpp: Get rid of some annoying debug ouput.

2004-06-09  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* Updated method for computing the fog color, based on the current
	  horizon color. Rather than using readPixels, which is slow,
	  sometimes drastically so, store the first (bottom) row of
	  the atmosphere texture in client memory, and do our own
	  interpolation.

2004-06-09  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* gui/Workspace.cpp: Start writing event processing code.

	* gui/Window.h, gui/Window.cpp: Add interface to pass mouse motion
	  events to windows.

	* gui/Widget.cpp: Clean up formatting.

	* gui/event.h: Add enum for event types.

2004-06-09  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* renderers/GL.cpp: Tweak light parameteres to give a smaller but
	  brighter pool of light.

2004-06-09  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* renderers/GL.cpp: Enable character light source, and provide
	  some sensible defaults for it.

	* src/Graphics.cpp: Modify the place where character lighting is
	  applied to make it easier to control relative position to the
	  character.

2004-06-08  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* renderers/GL.cpp: Remove pointless call to glClear.

	* environment/SkyDome.cpp: Clear screen after reading back fog
	  colour which eliminates flickering sky, and makes stars twinkle.

2004-06-07  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* Fix linux compilation of stars code. Thank goodness
	  I have a Loonix box these days.

2004-06-07  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* Add star rendering to the environment code. Very simple while the
	  renderer integration issues are sorted out; in the future, will use
	  point sprites and colors. 
	  
	* Add a stars state to states.cfg
	
	* Add an unsigned 8-bit RGBA color to common/types.h
	
	* Add a long 'skirt' to the sky dome, and hence always use pure
	  black as the glClear color. We still need the glReadPixel hack for
	  getting the fog color, will address that in a future change.

2004-06-07  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* gui/Workspace.cpp, gui/Workspace.h, src/System.cpp: Pass
	  SDL events to the gui code.

2004-06-05  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* environment/TerrainRenderer.cpp: Implement culling entire terrain
	  chunks using the Frustum test. Big speedup.

2004-06-04  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* gui/Container.cpp: Implement addChild() and showAll().

	* gui/Button.cpp: Use addChild for adding child widget.

	* gui/Frame.cpp: Get rid of default size.

	* gui/Toplevel.cpp, gui/Toplevel.h: Implement top level widget.

	* gui/Window.cpp, gui/Window.h: Add methods to change geometry.

	* gui/Workspace.cpp, gui/Workspace.h: Remove test widget,
	  and add methods to allow widgets to install stuff.

	* src/System.cpp: Test out new Toplevel.

2004-06-03  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* gui/Button.cpp, gui/Button.h, gui/Container.cpp, gui/Container.h,
	  gui/Graphic.h, gui/Label.cpp, gui/Label.h, gui/Widget.h,
	  gui/Workspace.cpp, gui/Workspace.h: Add show interface to widgets
	  for when they are ready to be rendered.

	* gui/Toplevel.h, gui/Toplevel.cpp: Class for top level widgets.

2004-06-03  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* XCode project updates - want to be able to revert to this
	  version if I break stuff.

2004-06-03  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* gui/Window.h, gui/Window.cpp: Add coords and size, adding children,
	  and the render interface which allows us to render windows
	  as a hierarchy.

	* gui/RootWindow.h, gui/RootWindow.cpp: Implement render to
	  iterate over children.

	* gui/Frame.h, gui/Frame.cpp: Fix render interface to comply with
	  base class, and draw based on window coords.

	* gui/Container.h, gui/Container.cpp: Remove render interface, as
	  this widget type is not rendered. Implement constructor and
	  destructor.

	* gui/Workspace.h, gui/Workspace.cpp: Make workspace
	  a container, so it can hold top level widgets. Implement
	  rendering the rootwindow when draw is called. Add a demo
	  widget.

2004-06-02  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* gui/Workspace.cpp: Fix test gui drawing code, and make it use
	  vertex arrays. Add necessary states entry.

2004-05-30  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* renderers/TextureManager.cpp: Fix texture load error detection,
	  and make output a little more useful.

	* renderers/ImageUtils.h: Add newline to end of file.

2004-05-30  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* Change an assert() on texture load errors to something less
	  violent, just print an error and stop generating mip-maps.

2004-05-30  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* Refactor texture ID generation, to avoid manual resizing of the
	  STL containers (they behave smartly anyway). As a result, got
	  rid of m_texture_counter completely (use m_names.size() instead)
	  
	* Added a general config option, base_texture_level, and a console
	  command, /set_texture_detail, to allow playing with texture
	  detail at runtime.
	  
	* Cleaned up the TextureManager's interactions (or lack of) with 
	  the config system.
	  
	* Factored the image load code into a helper file, ImageUtils.cpp
	
	* Rewrote the mip-mapping to never use SGIS_GENERATE_MIPMAPS,
	  since it is hard to integrate with dynamic texture detail reduction.
	  This also allows us to use arbitrary texture storage formats in
	  the future, since the only call we make to load textures is
	  glTexImage2D diurectly.
	  
	* Added custom mip-mapping code to ImageUtils.cpp : not the nicest
	  code ever, but pretty simple and it seems to work.

	* Found a latent bug in the texture loader, where 8-bit (single channel)
	  surfaces were being treated as 32-bit. I have default these to
	  GL_ALPHA for the moment, but perhaps they should default to
	  GL_LUMINANCE? Need to ask Al and Simon.
	  
	* Removed the include of SDL_image.h from System.h, since only two
	  source files (System.cpp and ImageUtils.cpp) ever call SDL_image
	  functions.

2004-05-28  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* gui/Workspace.h, gui/Workspace.cpp: Hold reference to system object
	  in gui, for access to renderer etc. Add text rendering code.

	* gui/Widget.h: Remove rendundant render() interface.

	* src/System.h, src/System.cpp, src/Graphics.cpp: Add a gui Workspace
	  into the render loop.

2004-05-28  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* Refactor texture config code, so we default to using
	  mipmaps. Ensure we use findItem before calling getItem.
	* When mipmapping is enabled for a texture, make the
	  default MIN_FILTER be GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR
	* Add in inital (hard-coded) logic to use a different
	  base mipmap level.

2004-05-26  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* Remove <strstream> check from configure, and usage from
	  Utility.h
	* Updated version of XCode project

2004-05-24  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* renderers/TextureManager.cpp, renderers/StateManager.cpp,
	  renderers/default_font.h: Use pure alpha texture for font,
	  and enable blending and get smoother less aliased text.

2004-05-24  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* gui/*: Updated ground work for gui widgets.

2004-05-24  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* Fix the compass to actually point north. Ooops.
	* Add a fail() handler to sprite, falling back to the default
	  texture and a fixed size, currently 64x64
	* Add XCode project file
	
2004-05-23  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* Add in a Sprite class, including a new config file, and changes
	  to the TextureManager to interoperate with Sprites. The original
	  Sprite code was lifted from Al's work in Apogee and modified to
	  work in sear.
	* Add a Compass class to the gui files, again taken from Apogee
	  and modified.
	* Change Graphics to create a compass and update it's angle.
	* Add a 'sprite' state to the state config file

2004-05-23  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/Character.h, src/Character.cpp: Add a make command that
	  allows the character to attempt to create arbitrary in game
	  objects. Also, sneak in a GNU compliant changelog entry, in
	  the hope that Simon might pick up the habbit :)

2004-05-23 James Turner <james@worldforge.org>

	* Twiddle SDL_mixer includes to work with the Mac package, and not pull in SDL/SDL.h
	  in the header file (only needed in Sound.cpp)
	* Stub in a sound enable / disable command, not hooked up right now
	* Remove the OS-X image load code, and use the SDL_image framework instead
	* Remove #include of config.h in Utility.h, very naughty.
