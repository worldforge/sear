 Sear
-====-

Sear is a 3-D client for use with the WorldForge project. It requires a 3-D accelerated graphics card supporting Open GL. Sear aims to be able to be used on relatively low power hardware.

Windows Information
-------------------

Run sear.bat to check for updates to Sear itself (nightly build versions) and then look for media updates. Sear-bin.exe can be run directly without launching the updater.
If "SYS_DRIVE:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Sear" is available (e.g. Win 2K and above) then Sear will download media updates and local configuation files from this directory. If this directory does not exist (e.g. Win 98) then updates and local configuation files will be stored in the current working directory.
Sear does *not* require administrator privileges to install or run. Administrator privileges may be required during installation if installing into the Program Files directory.

Linux Information
-----------------
On Linux systems, a shell script called "sear" is used in running the updater for Sear itself (nightly build versions only) and for media updates. The binary sear-bin can be run directly to avoid running the updater.
Local configuration files and updates will be stored in $HOME/.sear

Known Issues
------------

** On Ubuntu systems, Sear can fail to start due to the following error:

Creating link /home/sg/.kde/socket-echo.
can't create mcop directory.

  This can be worked around by setting the SDL_AUDIODRIVER environment variable
  before starting Sear. E.g.

  $> SDL_AUDIODRIVER=alsa /opt/worldforge/bin/sear


** Many Invalid Enum error messages

On systems with NV_point_sprite but not ARB_point_sprite, Mesa 7.2 has a bug where a call to glPointParameterf(GL_POINT_SPRITE_COORD_ORIGIN, ??) can cause GL_INVALID_ENUM to be thrown. Sear itself does not make this call, however Guichan indirectly calls this function.

Solution: Upgrade Mesa. 

** Gui breaks on character type selection.

This is a guichan bug which has been fixed in the current development version. 
Current work-around is to presss tab to move keyboard focus to the dropdown and then use the up/down cursor to select a character type.
